# Soil Sensor
Note: as of 1 May, 2020 the unit is no longer deployed. Water got into the box and shorted the LiPo charger. See [Issue #5](https://github.com/OilSlick/soil_sensor_socr/issues/5#issue-611115337). 

An Arduino-based soil sensor to measure the temperature and moisture content of two different samples of soil; one covered by a broad-leaf carpet grass and the other fully exposed. 

The sensor is part of a project for an intro to soil sciences class from Colorado State University. 

I gratuitously copied-and-pasted large chunks of code from example pages of each of the devices and I relied heavily on Adafruit documentation as well. I buy a lot of components from them for various other projects and I also pay for the Plus-level of service from [io.Adafruit](https://io.adafruit.com/). I highly recommend them.

There is more detail about the project on the [wiki page](https://github.com/OilSlick/soil_sensor_socr/wiki/Home/).
