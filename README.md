# Soil Sensor
An Arduino-based soil sensor to measure the temperature and moisture content of two different samples of soil; one covered by a broad-leaf carpet grass and the other fully exposed. 

The sensor is part of a project for an intro to soil sciences class from Colorado State University. 

### Basic Unit Operation

Collect the following data from two distinct soil locations:

1. Temperature of soil at 15cm
2. Percent soil moisture (a crude measure using a cheap sensor)
